    <h1>About Cats</h1>
    <ul>

      <h3>What is a cat?</h3>

      <p> The Felidae family includes everything from tigers, lions, cougars, ocelots, and lynxes to the domestic cats we keep in our homes. House cats are the smallest feline family members, but otherwise they share many characteristics with their larger, wild relatives. They have a wide variety of fur patterns, retractable claws, flexible bodies, rough tongues, sensitive whiskers, and large eyes with good night vision.</p>

      <h3> Where do cats live? </h3>

      <p> Domestic cats are found worldwide, though their popularity as pets does vary from region to region. The majority of the cat population—400 million out of the 600 million—live in Asia, with 58 million of those being house cats in China. The US tops the charts for cat ownership, with around the same amount of house cats as China despite a much lower human population. The UK is home to around 10.9 million house cats.</p>

      <h3> Evolution </h3>

      <p> According to recent studies, today’s domestic cats descend from two main lineages, the first of which came from Asia and into Europe around 4400 BCE. Farming settlements attracted rodents that fed on crops and agricultural byproducts, and the rodents, in turn, attracted their predators—cats. Since fewer rodents meant less trouble for the humans, it’s thought that they allowed the cats to live nearby to cull the rodent population.The second ancestor is the African wildcat from Egypt, Felis silvestris libyca, which spread into the Mediterranean in around 1500 BCE. It’s thought that this cat may have had social behaviour traits that people liked, and they began taking cats with them along trade routes on land and sea to control rodents while travelling.</p>

      <h3> Disasters preparedness </h3>

      <p> IFAW is dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and reuniting pets with their owners after disasters such as earthquakes, floods, or human conflicts. However, you can also do a lot to prepare for a disaster before it happens, ensuring you will be ready to keep your pet safe and healthy.The main things to think about are health and stress levels. If a disaster happens, you need to be able to feed, medicate, and keep your pet as calm as possible while you evacuate and stay away from home.To prepare, we recommend that you microchip your pet and register their information on a national database, keep up to date with vaccinations, ensure your pet is comfortable traveling in a carrier, and prepare a pet disaster kit.The kit should include essentials like two weeks’ worth of food, drinking water, a photo of you with your pet, a pet collar with ID, medical records, a pet carrier, portable bowls, a harness or leash, and any necessary medications.</p>
